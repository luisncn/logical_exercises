# Hello, my name is Luis Irausquin, I currently a software developer.

I work with the Python programming language and its frameworks Django and DRF

In my job search I came across these simple tests many times whose objective
is to evaluate our logic as programmers. In this repository I am solving these
tests in more depth and I leave it public so that you can compare your answers
and practice a little logic.

The main objective is to practice and understand the logic of the exercises.
Remember that if you only memorize the code, the loser is you and your career
as a developer. These are tests that can easily be solved on paper with logical
reasoning and controlling your nerves.

In my free time I practice logic exercises in Python and make simple pages in
Django for tests.
